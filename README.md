# JavaScript Runtimes Benchmarking

This repository contains benchmark scripts and instructions which were used in my bachelor thesis for comparing **Bun.js**, **Node.js**, and **Deno**. By running these tests on any machine or server, everyone can observe differences in startup speed, CPU-bound performance, and HTTP request handling among the three runtimes.
